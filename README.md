In this repository I examine data on marketing newsletters/e-mail campaigns (e-mail offers sent to customers) and customer transactions. I implement several unsupervised machine learning algorithms- K means, affinity propagation, spectral clustering, agglomerative clustering, and DBSCAN to cluster customers based on various measurements. I evaluate each modelâ€™s performance by qualitative metrics.
